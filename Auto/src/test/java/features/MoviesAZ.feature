Feature: User should be able to view Movies sorted from A to Z

Given I am on the AXIS RWA HOMEpage
When I hover my mouse over MOVIES link
Then A drop down frame appears containing option A-Z
And I click on the A-Z option
Then Movies are sorted alphabetically from A-Z
And This just a test to check branch out
